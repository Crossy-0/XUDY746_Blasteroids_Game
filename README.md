# Blasteroids
 An Asteroids-Based project curated during my university studies.



    ---Project Outline---

    This game was developed as part of an assignment during my studies at university. The premise of the project was to showcase effective use of the physics interactions within popular game development software such as the Unity or Unreal engine.

    The project requirements were as follows:
        -A basic environment consisting of 4 walls, and a bare minimum of 3 asteroids in the scene to begin with.
        -Basic keyboard interactions that allow player movement.
        -Physics based interactions between asteroids.
        -Levels that have increasing difficulty.
    
    While the project requirements only called for a basic implementation of these features, I decided on adding features such as:
        -Main Menu
        -High Score
        -Settings for changing keybinds, and altering volume levels
        -SFX and Music
        -Secondry Fire
        -Environmental Events to impact Gameplay
        -Power Ups
        -Post Processing
        -UI 
        -Health
        -Pause menu
        -Animations


    This project was developed using the 'Unity 2020.3.26f1' Version, and the project was submitted on the 22nd of March 2023. 


    This project was intended to showcase our abilities as solo developers in programming basic physics interactions within a game engine.
    However, as I had already gained experience with game development, I utilisied this project to learn about the usage of post processing, audio mixers, animations, and the new Unity Input System (new at the time).

    While the project is not perfect, it is a great example of how a basic idea can be built upon to create a functional game. 
    [Note] If you are reviewing the code involved within the project, please note that while this project was created and submitted in 2023, the code was cleaned up and altered more recently to ensure future readability.
